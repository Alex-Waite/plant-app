# Project 3: Eleanor

Project Eleanor is the third and final project I have been tasked to complete in the University of Adelaide's coding boot camp. The project must be built using a MERN stack and deployed through Heroku, The goal of the project is to demonstrate my new skills and proficiency in full stack development.

## -Concept-

My idea is to create a gardening subscription box service in which users can find specific plants to grow based on data from their location with a fallback plan of creating an E-Store for seeds online.

An alternate option would be to send a randoom selection of plants and provide a generated guide with Information on how to grow the plant, time to harvest,

The app would work by utilising API's to to link data based on location (_Factors such as humidity, rainfall and sunlight_) and to another API which will include data centered around the conditions certain crops/plants require to flourish. When the user sets up their profile I will gather all information nececary for the app to function. Then monthly the user would reciece a package of a few seeds/fertalizers/garderning tools that are fitting for the users conditions

## -Fallback-

As a subscription box service is quite an overwhelming task and very different to anything I have done before so if I feel a good option would be to build a basic seed Webstore and using the same API and everything so that once the basic functionallity of the store is complete I can create a "Buy a monthy Subscription" module to the store, this breaks my task into 2 and means if only the first component is completed the project is still presentable and the second module can be worked on as a passion project.
